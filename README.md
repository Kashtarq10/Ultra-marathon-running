# 🔍 Project Workflow
1. Data Collection & Cleaning
Loaded the .csv file using Pandas.

Handled missing and inconsistent values (e.g., incomplete age or distance fields).

Filtered out erroneous or duplicate entries.

Converted time columns to datetime format.

Parsed race date and standardized distance metrics.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Identified most common race distances and formats.

Analyzed gender-based and age-based participation trends.

Discovered country-wise participation and dominance.

Studied finish times vs. distance & pace distributions.

Detected record-setting performances.

3. Data Visualization
Bar plots of top-performing countries and age groups.

Line charts showing the rise in event popularity over the years.

Heatmaps for correlation among performance metrics.

Animated visualizations of marathon locations globally (optional).

# 📌 Conclusion
This project offers a deep dive into one of the most extensive endurance running datasets available. From historical trends to individual performance benchmarks, the analysis reveals key insights into the global ultra-running community and helps understand the evolution of human endurance.
